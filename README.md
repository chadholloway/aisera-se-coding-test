# Aisera Coding Test

## Requirements

SE candidates will be required to build and deliver a simple program.  You can use any programming language but Javascript, Python, and/or Powershell/Bash are preferred.

Candidates should fork this repo to deliver their project.

## Instructions

Create a [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1/) account and write a program that gets data from a REST endpoint and writes it somewhere else.

Example: *Use the Yahoo Finance `GET market/v2/get-movers` API endpoint to retrieve the top stock movers and write them (in easily readable format) to a local .txt document.*
